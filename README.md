# Project Title
This project demonstrates how to create a simple REST API using Express and Node.js, and how to create a Django web server with one model, e.g., “Product”, and implement CRUD operations via Django’s admin interface. It also shows how to connect your Express API to a SQLite database using any ORM, store and retrieve “User” data, create a Python script that acts as a proxy, and forward requests from the Python script to the Express API. Finally, it demonstrates how to make the Django web server fetch “User” data from the Express API via the Python proxy.
